Dimensionality and clustering

This project focus on customer analysis and segmentation. The goal is to understand the problem by analyzing existing marketing data to identify critical insights around customer characteristics and habits, spending and purchase patterns, and then segment customers into groups with similar traits
Proposed Model

The purposed model is the K-Medoid method for customer profiling. While the K-Means method is a widely used method, it is sensitive to outliers. The observed Marketing data has a high-amount of outliers that could impact insights due to K-Means use of the mean for calculating the center of a cluster. The K-Medoid method is not impacted by outliers.
